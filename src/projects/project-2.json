  "description": "Experiment with emotions in this emergent sandbox simulation by identifying, engaging, and expressing dynamic creatures known as Emoes -- all while trying to maintain balance and uncover the secrets of this mysterious alien world. Emoes are embodiments of human emotions, covering three levels of intensity of the central emotions of anger, happiness, and sadness.\nI built the in-game journal UI and synced up player achievements and events using the assets drawn by the creative director. Additionally, I programmed a variety of functionality and game feel-related features, including emoe attention, player input, and more.",
