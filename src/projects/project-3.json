  "description": "A tactical RPG where you build bonds with allies to unlock abilities, negotiate with enemies to recruit them, and shape your journey through choices that blend strategy, diplomacy, and emotional storytelling. Play as Enra, a gentle botanist, as she follows in her fatherâ€™s footsteps in search of a powerful artifact called The Chain.\nI primarily contributed as a member of the usability team, working directly with the usability lead. I conducted playtests both as part of the Advance Games Project course and externally throughout the semester. I transcribed playtester issues from video recordings, providing timestamps and proposed solutions to product facing teams.",
