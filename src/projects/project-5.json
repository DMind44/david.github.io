  "logline": "A true test of communication, match compatible singles on dates before time runs out in this chaotic tabletop game.",
  "description": "A cooperative race against time where you and your matchmaking partner try to match a selection of eligible singles before the deadline. Communication skills and chemistry are a must when trying to balance compatibility between traits, star signs, and location all while working with limited information. Match well enough, and you can become a Love God.\nMy contributions include creating various parts of game content, including character traits and aspects of card visual design. I collaborated on writing all iterations of the rules, and playtested with external participants, collecting data with Likert Scale surveys and iterating based on feedback.",
